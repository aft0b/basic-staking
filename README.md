## Project: Basic Staking Platform (Clarity)

### Project title
API for On-chain GPA – Integration for other apps

### Project Description
A minimal Clarity smart contract that implements a basic staking platform. Users can stake STX to the contract and withdraw their staked balance. The contract intentionally exposes just two public functions to keep the logic straightforward and easy to integrate into other applications.

### Project Vision
Provide a simple, auditable building block for on-chain services that need staking functionality — ideal for education, prototypes, and as a small component in larger on-chain systems (like reward engines, reputation systems, or academic-grade tracking integrations).

### Future scope
- Add reward distribution (time-weighted or fixed APY).
- Add lock-up periods and penalty logic for early withdrawal.
- Support staking of SIP-010 tokens (FT) instead of native STX.
- Add admin controls (pause, emergency withdraw) with proper access control.
- Add event/logging style patterns (via memo or custom maps) for easier off-chain indexing.
